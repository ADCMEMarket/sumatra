=======================
Using the web interface
=======================

The web interface is built using the Django http://www.djangoproject.com/ web
framework, and requires that Django be installed (see Installation).

Before using the web interface, you must have created a Sumatra project using
smt init.

To launch the web interface, in your project directory run::

    $ smtweb &
    
This will launch a simple web server that listens on port 8000. Now open your
browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000/

(If "localhost" doesn't work, try "127.0.0.1")

If port 8000 is already in use, you can specify a different port as an argument
to smtweb.

Don't forget to kill the webserver process (e.g. with fg, Ctrl-C) when you are
finished with it.
