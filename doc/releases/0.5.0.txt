===========================
Sumatra 0.5.0 release notes
===========================

* working directory now captured (as a parameter of :class:`LaunchMode`)
* data differences now based on content, not name, i.e. henceforth two files
  with identical content but different names (e.g. because the name contains a
  timestamp) will evaluate as being the same. (cf ticket:111)
* improved error messages when a required version control wrapper is not
  installed
* dependencies now capture the source from which the version was obtained
  (e.g. repository url)
* YAML-format parameter files are now supported (thanks to Tristan Webb)
* Added "upstream" attribute to the :class:`Repository` class, which may contain
  the URL of the repository from which your local repository was clone.
* Added `MirroredFileSystemDataStore`, which supports the case where files
  exist both on the local filesystem and on some web server (e.g. DropBox).
* the name/e-mail of the user who launched the computation is now captured
  (first trying :file:`~/.smtrc`, then the version control system)
* there is now a choice of methods for auto-generating labels when they are not
  supplied by the user: timestamp-based (the default and previously the only
  option) and uuid-based. Use the "-g" option to "smt configure".
* you can also specify the timestamp format to use (thanks to Yoav Ram).


Interfaces to documentation systems
-----------------------------------

Sumatra now provides tools to include figures and other results generated by
Sumatra-tracked computations in documents, with links to full provenance
information: i.e. the full details of the code, input data and computational
environment used to generate the figure/result.

The following tools are available:

* for reStructuredText/Sphinx: an *smtlink* role and *smtimage* directive.

* for LaTeX, a *sumatra* package, which provides the *\smtincludegraphics* command.

see :doc:`../publishing` for more details.
