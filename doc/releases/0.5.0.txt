===========================
Sumatra 0.5.0 release notes
===========================

* working directory now captured (as a parameter of LaunchMode)
* data differences now based on content, not name, i.e. henceforth two files with identical content but different names (e.g. because the name contains a timestamp) will evaluate as being the same. (cf ticket:111)
* improved error messages when a required version control wrapper is not installed
* dependencies now capture the source from which the version was obtained (e.g. repository url)
* YAML-format parameter files are now supported (thanks to Tristan Webb)


Not yet merged
* switch from optparse to argparse (which allows...)
* Added "upstream" attribute to the Repository class (which means...)
* Added `MirroredFileSystemDataStore`, which supports the case where files exist both on the local filesystem and on some web server (e.g. DropBox).

Interfaces to documentation systems
-----------------------------------

* reStructuredText/Sphinx: smtlink role and smtimage directive
