* Where does the name "Sumatra" come from?

It is based on the initial letters of "Simulation Management Tool".
(Sumatra was originally conceived for tracking simulations, it was only later
that I realized it could equally well be used for any command-line driven
computation). Despite a certain geographical proximity, it has nothing to do
with Java :-)
