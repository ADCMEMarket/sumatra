============
Installation
============

Sumatra may be downloaded from http://xxx.xxx/sumatra/Download. To install it,
first unpack the tar archive::

    $ tar xzf Sumatra-0.1.tar.gz
    $ cd Sumatra-0.1
    # python setup.py install
    
The last step may need to be run as root, or using sudo.

Installing Django
-----------------

If you wish to use the web interface, you will also need to install Django. On
Linux, you may be able to do this via your package management system: see
http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/Distributions.

Otherwise, it is very easy to install manually: see
http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/install/#installing-official-release
