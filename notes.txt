Notes on Sumatra refactoring
============================

Should support
    (i) use from command line (smt)
    (ii) use from a GUI
    (iii) an API (use from within a simulation script)
    
Functionality:
    * launch simulations, and record various pieces of information about the
      simulation, including:
        - the executable (identity, version)
        - the script (identity, version)
        - the parameters
        - the duration (execution time)
        - console output
        - links to all data (whether in files, in a database, etc.) produced by the simulation
        - the reason for doing the simulation
        - the outcome of the simulation
    * allow browsing/searching/visualising the results of previous simulations
    * allow the re-running of previous simulations with automatic verification that the results are unchanged
    * launch single or batch simulations, serial or parallel
    
Principal classes:
    SimProject
    SimRecord
    
Running a simulation creates a SimRecord object and associates it with a SimProject. How the SimRecord stores its data
(in a text file, binary file, database) should be decoupled from its interface.
